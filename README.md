This project is an HTML and CSS-based responsive clone of Spotify's web application. It is intended to mimic the structure and aesthetic of the Spotify web player without the use of any pre-made CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap. 
I'd like to introduce you to a stunning HTML and CSS-made Spotify clone. This clone's seamless design embraces the core of the original platform while providing a user-friendly interface and aesthetically pleasing appearance.
